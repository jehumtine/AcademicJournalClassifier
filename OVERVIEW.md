## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a classifier to categorize academic journal articles. The main workflow is documented in `notebooks/AcademicJournalClassifier.ipynb`, which covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## TODO List

- [ ] Collect and clean journal article data
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Engineer relevant features for classification
- [ ] Implement and compare multiple classification algorithms
- [ ] Evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters
- [ ] Save and deploy the best-performing model
- [ ] Document results and findings

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Explore the workflow in `notebooks/AcademicJournalClassifier.ipynb`.
