    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The University of Zambia (UNZA) hosts a growing repository of academic journal articles across multiple disciplines. However, these articles are not systematically categorized according to Zambia’s Vision 2030 development sectors. This lack of alignment presents a missed opportunity to leverage UNZA’s intellectual output for national strategic planning, policy formulation, and sectoral development monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a data-driven classification system that maps UNZA journal articles to the appropriate Vision 2030 sectors using machine learning techniques. By automating this classification, we intend to bridge the gap between academic research and national development priorities, enabling policymakers, researchers, and institutions to better identify and track sectoral contributions and trends."
